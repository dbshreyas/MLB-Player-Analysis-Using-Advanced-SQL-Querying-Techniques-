# MLB-Player-Analysis-Using-Advanced-SQL-Querying-Techniques-

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world data analyst internship with Major League Baseball (MLB), leveraging decades of historical player data. Using advanced SQL techniques, the project analyzes player performance trends, salary evolution, player demographics, team associations, and more.

The goal is to explore how various statistics — such as career length, salaries, schools, and physical attributes — have evolved over time and across teams.

## Dataset Description
The data includes information on:

1. Players: Personal details, debut/final games, physical stats
2. Salaries: Player salaries by year and team
3. Schools: Educational background of players
4. School Details: Full names and details of institutions

## Analysis

The analysis is grouped into four sections:

#### 1. School Analysis (https://github.com/dbshreyas/MLB-Player-Analysis-Using-Advanced-SQL-Querying-Techniques-/blob/main/queries/1_school_analysis.sql)

#### 2. Salary Analysis (https://github.com/dbshreyas/MLB-Player-Analysis-Using-Advanced-SQL-Querying-Techniques-/blob/main/queries/2_salary_analysis.sql)

#### 3. Player Career Analysis (https://github.com/dbshreyas/MLB-Player-Analysis-Using-Advanced-SQL-Querying-Techniques-/blob/main/queries/3_player_career_analysis.sql)

#### 4. Player Comparison Analysis (https://github.com/dbshreyas/MLB-Player-Analysis-Using-Advanced-SQL-Querying-Techniques-/blob/main/queries/4_player_comparison_analysis.sql)
